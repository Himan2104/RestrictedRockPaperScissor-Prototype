# Restricted Rock Paper Scissor

A prototype for RRPS as seen in Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor.

To be developed into an MMO card game.

Project is on hold for [Rengine](https://himan2104.github.io/Rengine). It was planned to be developed on Unity but Rengine seems more viable now since my android/ios tests are going very good.

## Roadmap
- Prototype
- Prototype Local Game
- Prototype Game Server
- Develop Application
- Server Resolution
